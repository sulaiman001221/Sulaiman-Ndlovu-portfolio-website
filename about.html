          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Sulaiman Ndlovu, a passionate web developer with a strong
            background in creating dynamic and responsive web applications. With

          </p>

          <h3>My Journey</h3>
          <p>
            My journey into the world of web development began with a curiosity
            for how websites work. I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, and soon, I was creating small projects and
            experimenting with various web technologies. This passion led me
            decide to pursue formal education and training in web development,
            where I am currently expanding my skills and knowledge.
          </p>

          <h3>My View on AI</h3>
          <p>
            I personally believe that AI won't take our jobs. Instead, it
            enhances our lives as software developers. AI makes us more
            productive, teaching us quickly and enabling us to solve problems
            that have already been addressed efficiently. Our role as software
            developers is to discover unsolved problems, create solutions, and
            then teach AI so that it can assist others. This collaboration with
            AI not only accelerates our work but also drives innovation,
            allowing us to focus on more complex and creative challenges.
          </p>
